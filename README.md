Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

css
Copy code
our-hospital/
  src/
    components/
      Navbar.js
      Home.js
      Footer.js
      ContactUs.js
      AboutUs.js
      Doctor.js
      Patient.js
      Admin.js
      Login.js
      Signup.js
    services/
      api.js
    utils/
      auth.js
    App.js
    index.js
    ...
The components directory contains all the React components used in the website.
The services directory contains the API service file (api.js) responsible for making HTTP requests to the backend.
The utils directory contains the authentication utility file (auth.js) that handles user authentication and role-based access.
The App.js file is the entry point of the application, where the routing and main component rendering take place.
The index.js file is the main JavaScript file that renders the React app.
User Signup and Login
When a user signs up using the Signup component, they can select their role as either a doctor or a patient. This data is inserted into the database using an API controller call.
Upon successful login, a token is generated for the user, which is used for subsequent authentication and role verification.
The user's role is fetched from the token, and the specific components are displayed accordingly. Users are restricted from accessing components that are not relevant to their role.
Patient and Doctor Features
In the Patient component, patients can avail the available services provided by the hospital. They can also schedule appointments with doctors.
Doctors, represented by the Doctor component, can approve appointments made by patients.
The Admin role is responsible for activating doctor accounts.
